# Fraudulent-Transactions-Prediction
The Dataset is to be identify about a transaction to predict whether it is Fraudulent or Not
BUSINESS STATEMENT:
In recent times, the number of fraud transactions has increased drastically, due to which companies are facing a lot of challenges. For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the most important business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal. In this project, We are building a fraud detection model to help banks identify frauds and be vigilant enough to reduce losses incurred due to such unauthorised transactions by the fraudsters.

We are presented with a labeled dataset of financial transactions, some of which are fraudulent. We will be performing exploratory data analysis on this data, and then creating a classifier model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent given the included features. The objective of this project is to explain my thought processes in solving this problem, as well as addressing some of the issues that inherently face machine learning models. ("All models are wrong, but some are useful.") Using this notebook, I hope to focus primarily on transparency and clarity rather than raw predictive performance, and readability for an audience without a specialization in data science.
